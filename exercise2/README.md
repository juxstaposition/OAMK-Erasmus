# OAS generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [oas-generator](https://github.com/isa-group/oas-generator) project.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [oas-tools](https://github.com/isa-group/oas-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
